#Django News Application
##Created By: Michael Niekamp using the Django web application framework.
This News application allows users to sign up for an account where journalists can post articles that only they can edit or delete. Other users can also comment on articles but there are user authorization tactics in place to prevent unauthorized users from editing or deleting posts they did not create.
